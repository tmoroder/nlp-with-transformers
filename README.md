# My Repo on Natural Language Processing with Transformers

This is my repo to reproduce and to code snippets from the transformers book: 
[Natural Language Processing With Transformers](https://transformersbook.com/).

My expectations are to obtain a better and coherent background on current SOTA techniques in NLP and related topcis.
